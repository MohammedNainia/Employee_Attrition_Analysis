# HR Analytics Project

I just completed a comprehensive HR Analytics report, focusing on employee attrition and its various influencing factors. This project delves into aspects such as environment satisfaction, job involvement, performance ratings, job satisfaction, and work-life balance.

## What I Did

**Data Cleaning with Power Query:**
- Deleted redundant columns
- Renamed columns for clarity
- Dropped duplicates
- Cleaned individual columns
- Removed NaN values
- Applied necessary transformations to ensure data accuracy (grouping numbers into string texts to ensure data consistency using Power Query)

**Key Highlights:**
- Average Monthly Income and Hourly Rate
- Attrition Analysis by Environment Satisfaction, Job Involvement, Performance Rating, Job Satisfaction, and Work-Life Balance
- Visualized insights to help HR develop effective wellness strategies and improve employee retention

This report was created using Power BI and Power Query, with a focus on making data-driven decisions to enhance overall organizational performance and squeeze all the information available from the sheet.
