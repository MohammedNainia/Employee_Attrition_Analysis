## HR Analytics Project

I recently completed a comprehensive HR Analytics project, focusing on employee attrition and various influencing factors such as environment satisfaction, job involvement, performance ratings, job satisfaction, and work-life balance. This project utilized both Power BI and Python for in-depth analysis.

### What I Did

**Data Cleaning with Power Query:**
- Deleted redundant columns
- Renamed columns for clarity
- Dropped duplicates
- Cleaned individual columns
- Removed NaN values
- Applied necessary transformations to ensure data accuracy (e.g., grouping numbers into string texts using Power Query)

**Analysis with Power BI:**
- **Visualized Key Metrics**: Analyzed average monthly income, hourly rate, and other critical metrics.
- **Attrition Analysis**: Examined attrition trends by environment satisfaction, job involvement, performance rating, job satisfaction, and work-life balance.
- **Developed Insights**: Created dashboards and reports to help HR develop effective wellness strategies and improve employee retention.

**Analysis with Python:**
- **Data Cleaning**: Loaded and cleaned data, handled missing values, and converted categorical variables to numeric codes.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Generated a correlation matrix to understand relationships between numeric variables.
  - Created distribution plots for factors like overtime, marital status, job roles, gender, and education fields.
  - Used box plots to analyze relationships between overtime and other variables such as age, total working years, and the number of companies worked at.
- **Visualization**: Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful visualizations, including heatmaps, count plots, and box plots.

This project aimed to provide a thorough analysis of employee attrition to help HR develop data-driven strategies for improving employee retention and organizational performance.
